At first when I developed this plugin I did it because nothing was working fine! After having a good version I released it to public so others can enjoy it :)
A few months later and the plugin started to be a success. So people wanted to have new features implemented!

Maintaining the plugin and adding new features it's made in my spare time!
If you do want to help me first you can **star this plugin**. And if you realllly want to help me, you can donate through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5QLCDRNH77Z9L&source=url) whatever you think I deserve :D
